      release of Nanite, Unreal's new virtualized geometry system. I took the opportunity
      to experiment with this innovative technique, exploring how it could optimize
      asset performance and enhance the visual fidelity of the game. This hands-on

      a significant role in designing DLC content for the game, focusing on how users
      would interact with it. One key takeaway was the importance of presenting multiple
      design options to stakeholders, allowing for flexibility and quick adjustments
      based on their feedback. This experience taught me how to navigate the iterative
      process of design in a large, dynamic team environment.

    m_Localized: "During my research phase, I uncovered a significant challenge in
      the gaming industry: many games fail to engage their target audience effectively.
      Despite offering strong gameplay, they often struggle to capture players' attention
      within the critical first moments. This insight led me to develop the '15-second
      rule,' a concept I coined to emphasize that a game has just 15 seconds to engage
      a player. If it doesn\u2019t make an immediate connection, players are likely
      to decide it\u2019s not for them within that brief window.\n\nThroughout my
      research, I also connected with several industry professionals via LinkedIn,
      many of whom generously took the time to speak with me or complete questionnaires
      that significantly contributed to my findings. Once I had gathered all the
      data, I focused on creating a low-fidelity prototype that addressed the pain
      points identified through the research and feedback. After conducting user
      testing on the low-fi prototype and incorporating the insights gained, I proceeded
      to develop the high-fidelity version."

      they were just beginning their project. Upon completion, the team was very
      pleased with the result, particularly the logo, which led to me being asked

      The product lead was incredibly kind and supportive, recognizing that I was
      still new to the process and providing valuable guidance along the way. The
      project also pushed me to explore design solutions outside of my comfort zone.
      For instance, the gun creation screen was initially designed as a static 2D
      interface, similar to the older Call of Duty games. However, I later came up
      with the idea of showcasing the gun in 3D with dynamic 2D widgets surrounding
      it. This concept only became feasible after I took the initiative to discuss
      it with one of the developers to confirm its technical viability. This experience
      taught me the importance of cross-department communication, which proved to
      be incredibly valuable in bringing ideas to life.

    m_Localized: "Murloc RPG was a project I started as a personal evaluation moment.
      About a year ago, I began learning C#, and since then, I\u2019ve become deeply
      immersed in mastering my first programming language. I had previously tried
      to create a full game from start to finish with the Viking Survival project,
      but due to my dependence on ChatGPT at the time, I struggled to properly refactor
      my code and apply feedback from alpha testing.\n\nWith Murloc RPG, I aimed
      to demonstrate that I had overcome those challenges. This project allowed me
      to show my progress in coding, as well as implement better practices. Additionally,
      I wanted to challenge myself by integrating FMOD into the project for the first
      time, learning how to use it alongside existing code and gameplay elements."

      a wide range of items for purchase, all of which can be easily assigned to
      shopkeepers by providing a list of Item ScriptableObjects (ItemSOs). The video
      also highlights the tooltip functionality I created, allowing players to view
      basic information and stats for each item."

      The indicator above the NPC\u2019s head dynamically changes based on the current
      state of the quest it holds, providing clear visual feedback to the player."

      the interaction, a smooth transition overlay is played to enhance the experience."

      When the player encounters an enemy, the enemy\u2019s portrait appears, and
      a teleportation sequence is triggered. I\u2019ve also implemented an event
      broadcasting system to enable or disable certain behaviors as needed during
      the encounter."

      created. This was one of the first times I connected animations with actual
      code, making it incredibly rewarding when it all worked. I also ensured that
      the rocks had rigidbodies, allowing them to collide with or be stopped by other
      objects. This feature would be particularly important in a PvP setting, adding
      depth to the gameplay."

      into a cohesive scene."

      locked."
