    m_Localized: "During a two-month engagement at Netcompany stepping in for the
      absent UX/UI designer, I not only maintained but significantly expanded the
      existing Figma design system\u2014creating a suite of reusable components,
      documenting best-practice usage guidelines, and ensuring visual consistency
      across every screen\u2014but also led the end-to-end design and prototyping
      of a robust \u201Cschool-to-school\u201D administration interface. By conducting
      rapid user research with platform administrators, defining clear information
      architecture with faceted search, paginated lists, and contextual action menus,
      and iterating closely with developers on responsive prototypes, I delivered
      an intuitive, scalable solution that empowered administrators to search, filter,
      and connect thousands of schools efficiently while meeting all project deadlines."

    m_Localized: I was a core contributor to the end-to-end digitization of a multi-departmental
      government-funding approval workflow at Netcompany. Working alongside finance,
      legal, compliance and executive teams, I helped replace a paper-based routing
      process with a unified electronic platform. Through user research, contextual
      interviews and weekly design workshops, I gathered requirements, defined user
      flows and refined high-fidelity prototypes with primary stakeholders. Collaborating
      closely with engineers and DevOps, I ensured data schemas supported funding
      tranches, audit trails and automated notifications. The resulting application
      enabled real-time proposal tracking, reduced manual follow-ups by 70%, and
      cut submission errors by over 50%, significantly accelerating decision-making
      and enhancing transparency across all involved departments.

    m_Localized: "During my tenure at Rijkswaterstaat, I was tasked with enhancing
      the user interface and user experience of a project previously developed by
      an external contractor, whose deliverable had fallen short of expectations.
      My assignment involved a comprehensive redesign of both the workflow and visual
      presentation to align with Rijkswaterstaat\u2019s standards.\n\nA critical
      requirement was the systematic collection of environmental data from multiple
      sites across the Netherlands. This included metrics such as water levels, temperature,
      and soil moisture, among others. To address this need, I developed a centralized
      platform enabling field personnel to submit consistent data. I designed a customizable
      template generator, allowing project coordinators to define the required input
      fields, which ensured uniform data entry and streamlined analysis across all
      locations."

    m_Localized: 'During my tenure at Netcompany, I was promoted to Business Analyst
      in recognition of my strong interest in programming and system design, and
      to address a high demand for analytical support. In this role, I served as
      the primary liaison between our development team and key stakeholders at CAK,
      ensuring clear communication and alignment of expectations.


      I led the
      effort to digitalize and streamline a previously rigid, error-prone workflow
      that involved multiple parties, each with unique requirements. To achieve this,
      I meticulously documented all processes and coordinated regular stakeholder
      consultations to validate feasibility and identify potential roadblocks. When
      issues arose, I proactively escalated concerns to the appropriate decision-makers,
      enabling timely reprioritization and maintaining project momentum.'

    m_Localized: "During my first role at VVA, I was recruited for my expertise in
      graphic design and UX/UI, with my background in gaming immediately recognized
      as an asset. The company was actively exploring gamification strategies to
      enhance user engagement within its custom-solutions portfolio. In this capacity,
      I conceptualized and developed interactive modules and micro-games\u2014such
      as scenario-based quizzes and achievement \u201Cbadges\u201D\u2014that guided
      users through complex workflows, fostering both learning and adoption of new
      processes. These playful elements not only boosted user satisfaction scores
      by an average of 20% but also reduced training time by nearly 15%.\n\nBeyond
      hands-on design work, I took ownership of the department\u2019s branding initiative.
      I led the redesign of the department website\u2014now featured in the \u201CGaming\u201D
      section of my portfolio\u2014ensuring a cohesive look and feel that reflected
      our innovative approach. To support repeatable, on-brand communication, I also
      created a comprehensive asset library: templated slide decks, iconography sets,
      and style guidelines that empowered the sales and client-services teams to
      produce consistent presentations with minimal effort. "
