    m_Localized: "During my research phase, I uncovered a significant challenge in
      the gaming industry: many games fail to engage their target audience effectively.
      Despite offering strong gameplay, they often struggle to capture players' attention
      within the critical first moments. This insight led me to develop the '15-second
      rule,' a concept I coined to emphasize that a game has just 15 seconds to engage
      a player. If it doesn\u2019t make an immediate connection, players are likely
      to decide it\u2019s not for them within that brief window.\n\nThroughout my
      research, I also connected with several industry professionals via LinkedIn,
      many of whom generously took the time to speak with me or complete questionnaires
      that significantly contributed to my findings. Once I had gathered all the
      data, I focused on creating a low-fidelity prototype that addressed the pain
      points identified through the research and feedback. After conducting user
      testing on the low-fi prototype and incorporating the insights gained, I proceeded
      to develop the high-fidelity version."

      powerful role that color can play in design when used effectively. While some
      reviewers mentioned that I occasionally overused color, they also appreciated
      the contrast it created compared to the dark green and grey tones of the original

      was tasked with creating a style guide to provide direction for the team, as
      they were just beginning their project. Upon completion, the team was very
      pleased with the result, particularly the logo, which led to me being asked
      to design initial concepts for several screens. While these designs may not
      be used in the final product, they served as a valuable starting point for
      the team to explore different options and consider the direction of the project.

    m_Localized: This project was an ideal starting point for my freelance career.
      The product lead was incredibly kind and supportive, recognizing that I was
      still new to the process and providing valuable guidance along the way. The
      project also pushed me to explore design solutions outside of my comfort zone.
      For instance, the gun creation screen was initially designed as a static 2D
      interface, similar to the older Call of Duty games. However, I later came up
      with the idea of showcasing the gun in 3D with dynamic 2D widgets surrounding
      it. This concept only became feasible after I took the initiative to discuss
      it with one of the developers to confirm its technical viability. This experience
      taught me the importance of cross-department communication, which proved to
      be incredibly valuable in bringing ideas to life.

      I chose to step outside my comfort zone and take it on myself as a personal
      challenge. While it pushed me creatively, it also helped me grow and expand

      either create a unified design that worked across both environments or develop
      two separate solutions tailored to each platform. The brief also required the
      inclusion of a map component within the system.


      In addition to fulfilling
      the core requirements, I took the initiative to introduce a categorization
