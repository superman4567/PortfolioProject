    m_Localized: Murloc RPG is a fan game inspired by the original Murloc RPG game.
      In this version, you play as a younger murloc who must save his small friends
      after a spell causes the elder creatures to become overly aggressive and attack
      them.

    m_Localized: "Murloc RPG was a project I started as a personal evaluation moment.
      About a year ago, I began learning C#, and since then, I\u2019ve become deeply
      immersed in mastering my first programming language. I had previously tried
      to create a full game from start to finish with the Viking Survival project,
      but due to my dependence on ChatGPT at the time, I struggled to properly refactor
      my code and apply feedback from alpha testing.\n\nWith Murloc RPG, I aimed
      to demonstrate that I had overcome those challenges. This project allowed me
      to show my progress in coding, as well as implement better practices. Additionally,
      I wanted to challenge myself by integrating FMOD into the project for the first
      time, learning how to use it alongside existing code and gameplay elements."

      state of the quest it holds, providing clear visual feedback to the player."

      broadcasting system to enable or disable certain behaviors as needed during

      created. This was one of the first times I connected animations with actual
      code, making it incredibly rewarding when it all worked. I also ensured that
      the rocks had rigidbodies, allowing them to collide with or be stopped by other
      objects. This feature would be particularly important in a PvP setting, adding
      depth to the gameplay."
