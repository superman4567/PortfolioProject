    m_Localized: Bound Forest is the sequel to the original 2020 release, starring
      Josh on a quest to collect all the magic stones and overcome any foes in his
      path. In this new installment, Josh wields dual daggers, emphasizing high-speed
      combat and seamless attack chaining to deliver a faster, more fluid gameplay
      experience.

      balance enemy attacks, polished VFX (dust trails, lighting flashes) for punchy
      feedback, and optimized decision loops and effect pipelines to keep performance
      rock-solid during frantic fights. Iterative playtests then honed the combat\u2019s

    m_Localized: Murloc RPG is a fan game inspired by the original Murloc RPG game.
      In this version, you play as a younger murloc who must save his small friends
      after a spell causes the elder creatures to become overly aggressive and attack
      them.

    m_Localized: I built a flexible Unity event engine for elder aggression, refined
      scripting for spells and difficulty curves, and added real-time telemetry for
      spawn-rate tuning. Modular UI components for health, inventory, and buffs reinforced
      decoupled systems and data-driven iteration.
